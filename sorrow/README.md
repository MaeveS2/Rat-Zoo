## Description
This very small rat originates from a 6 second youtube video which claims to be a tutorial on how to get SBE for free. The video provides a link to download the mod, which is only 2.6kB in size (surely this is the real skyblock extras).
The mod only contains one class, `SocketUtils.java`. This class gets the minecraft token, ign and UUID. These are then sent to `85.239.61.56/sorrow.php`.
